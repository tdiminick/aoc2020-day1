## Project 1
This problem involves taking a list of numerical inputs. Finding the two that add up
to 2020, then multiply those numbers together and the answer is the answer to the problem.

## Project 2
This problem is the same as project 1, only instead of two inputs, we are looking for
three inputs that add to 2020, then multiplying those together to get the answer to this problem.
